# Project Title: Storm A Brewin' AR Game 
## KIVAS Expo Project
### Introduction
An augmented reality "treasure hunt" game built using A-Frame and AR.js. Help the friendly witch brew up a potion to pass her finals! Search for hidden markers/ingredients and tap the screen to collect the item on each marker.

### Tech/Frameworks
A-Frame, AR.js, HTML, CSS, Javascript

### How to Use it?
Talk to the witch on [the homepage](https://creative.colorado.edu/~vyle7651/dev/expo/home.html). From there, start the search for the ingredients she asked for. On the [AR site](https://creative.colorado.edu/~vyle7651/dev/expo/), place the markers you find in the frame and tap the screen to collect the item. To play this game at home, markers are found in the [markers.pdf file] (https://github.com/sleepvy/expo/blob/master/markers.pdf) and can be printed out and hidden around a room. This game uses matrix markers 0-4.


You've won the game when you've collected all the markers. You can view your status by looking at the bar at the top of the screen.
