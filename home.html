	<h1>Storm a Brewin'</h1>
	<h4>Hello!</h4>
	<p>
		Welcome to Storm a Brewin'. In this AR (Augmented Reality) game, you will be sent on a wild adventure! 
	</p>
	<p>
		You were wandering in the wicked woods of the ATLAS building, and stumbled upon the little witch, [name]. Finals are coming up fast, and she needs your help to ace her exams! She enlisted you to help her collect some rare ingredients to brew up a certain-A potion. 
	</p>
	<p>
		You need to collect: 
		<ul>
			<li>A puddle of tears</li>
			<li>A shot of coffee</li>
			<li>An ounce of hope</li>
			<li>One Ch(egg)</li>
			<li>A dash of exhaustion</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
	<p>
		Look around the ATLS Expo to find these items! You will know you have found an item when you see a paper QR tag like this:
		<img src="img/qrexample.png" alt="example qr code">
		Point your phone at it and see what you have found! Then, collect the item by clicking it. 
	</p>
	<p>
		Best of luck helping the little witch pass her exams (and good luck on your own)! Enjoy the adventure.
